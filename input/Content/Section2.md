## Evaluation of Adult PBPK models

The PBPK models of **amikacin**, and **vancomycin** were developed with clinical pharmacokinetic data covering at least administrations given in children. Plasma concentrations following intravenous administration, oral administration, multiple dose application, fractions excreted to urine or bile and other clinical measurements were included for model development whenever available.
