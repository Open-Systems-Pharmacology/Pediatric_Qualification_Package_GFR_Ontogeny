### Amikacin adult PBPK model

Amikacin is a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic used for a number of bacterial infections. Amikacin is adminstered in several forms, including intravenous or intramuscular injection. The PBPK of Amikacin has been previously developed in PK-Sim using clinical studies in preterm-neonates. [1] Here we have evaluated its predictive performance of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) mediated clearance in adults and term born children. In this chapter we show that amikacin adequately described the pharmacokinetics of amikacin in adults, based on the PBPK model build and reported in preterm-neonates.

The Amikacin model was evaluated in its performance in adults using data of the following  publication:

- Walker JM, Wise R, Mitchard M. The pharmacokinetics of amikacin and gentamicin in volunteers: a comparison of individual differences. J Antimicrob Chemother. 1979 Jan;5(1):95-9.
